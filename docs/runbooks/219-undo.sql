-- ===================================================================
-- 219-undo.sql: take migration 219 (a workflow endpoint contributes its own
-- tenancy to an edge's meet; the evolve_step lineage-executor read) back out,
-- in ONE transaction, on the migration (superuser) DSN.
--
-- READ FIRST: ROLL THE BINARIES BACK BEFORE THIS RUNS. A 219 binary calls
-- `epigraph_step_lineage_executors` in the `evolve_step` authority
-- gates (REST `POST /api/v1/workflows/steps/:id/evolve`, MCP `evolve_step`);
-- a unit left serving after this undo answers every evolve of a step some
-- workflow executes with an error (42883). An older binary calls nothing 219
-- added.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES:
--   * re-states 070's `epigraph_node_tenancy(uuid, text)` and 168's
--     `epigraph_propagate_tenancy()` byte for byte (`CREATE OR REPLACE` keeps
--     their owner and ACL; never DROP them: a DROP resets the ACL and breaks
--     every trigger and policy that names them);
--   * drops `epigraph_step_lineage_executors(uuid)` (nothing in SQL names
--     it);
--   * REFUSES, changing nothing, unless both functions hold 219's bodies (or
--     already hold 070's and 168's, a second run). A later migration that
--     re-stated either one (a merged body) would otherwise be reverted to
--     168's, losing that migration's change: undo that migration first.
--
-- WHAT IT LEAVES:
--   * every edge 219's section 4 narrowed, and every edge written or re-met
--     while 219 was applied, as it stands: an edge with a group-private
--     workflow endpoint STAYS group (fail-closed). Re-widening one is a
--     maintenance act on its own, never part of this undo;
--   * 219's `_sqlx_migrations` row.
-- AFTER IT: an `executes` edge from a group plan onto a public step is
-- written public again, and the rolled-back `evolve_step` gate no longer sees
-- a plan whose edge it cannot read (the pre-219 behaviour).
-- Re-introducing any of it is a NEW migration, never a re-run of 219.
-- Idempotent: a second run changes nothing.
